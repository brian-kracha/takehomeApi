To start up the application first make sure NPM is installed in the directory by running `npm install` or `npm i`.

### `npm start`

The server should be up and running on *`https://localhost:8000/products`*

I would have rather worked with a live database instead of seeded data but it was a fun challenge to build.

I appreciate your team at Backbone for taking the time to review my application.

I look forward to hearing your feedback!
